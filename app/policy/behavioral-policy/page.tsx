              Booking and Trip Guidelines
            </span>
            Passengers are required to book all trips on the Urban mobile or web
            app, or through a Dispatch Officer.
            <br />
            Passengers are required to arrive at the departure park at least 30
            minutes before their departure time.
            <br />
            Passengers are required to cooperate with the Park Officials, and
            Drivers at all times. If you are running late, kindly contact the
            Park or the Customer Experience Team to inform them. Getting on a
            Bus without having a booking for the trip or taking a trip using
            another customerâ€™s booking is not permitted. When in doubt about
            your trip, please contact the Customer Experience Team.

            1.1 Respect for Others: Passengers must treat fellow passengers,
            drivers, and Urban staff with respect, courtesy, and dignity. Any
            form of discrimination, harassment, verbal abuse, or physical
            assault will not be tolerated.
            <br />
            1.2 Personal Space: Passengers should respect the personal space of
            others and avoid unnecessary physical contact or invasion of
            privacy.
            <br />
            1.3 Noise and Volume: Passengers should maintain a reasonable noise
            level during their journey, ensuring that the volume of
            conversations, electronic devices, or any other activities does not
            disturb or inconvenience others.

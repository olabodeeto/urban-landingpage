            Trip Cancellation Policy

            The trip cancellation policy guidelines aim to ensure fairness,
            transparency, and efficient handling of trip cancellations. This
            policy is designed to provide clear expectations for passengers
            while mitigating potential revenue losses due to last-minute
            cancellations.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className="">1. Penalty for Same-Day Cancellation</span>
            <br />A penalty of 25% of the fare will be applied if a trip is
            canceled on the same day it is scheduled to occur. The penalty
            amount will be calculated based on the total fare for the trip.
            However, the penalty will be capped at a maximum of N2,000.00. This
            cap ensures that the penalty remains reasonable and proportional to
            the fare.
            <br />
            <span className="">
              2. Penalty for Different-Day Cancellation
            </span>{" "}
            <br />A penalty of 10% of the fare will be applied if a trip is
            canceled on a different day from the day the Trip is scheduled to
            occur. The penalty amount will be calculated based on the total fare
            for the trip. Different-Day cancellation is free for users who have
            subscribed for a number of trips. However, the penalty will be
            capped at a maximum of N2,000.00. This cap ensures that the penalty
            remains reasonable and proportional to the fare.
            <br />
            <span>3. Free Cancellation within 10 Minutes of Booking </span>
            <br />
            Passengers will have the flexibility to cancel their trips for free
            within the first 10 minutes after making a booking. This option
            allows passengers to correct any booking errors or change their
            minds shortly after making a reservation without incurring any
            charges.
